# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# BMI = weight(kg) / heightÂ²

# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

# "Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."
# "Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."
# "Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."
# "Your BMI is 33, you are obese."
# "Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."
