# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index(BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight ( in kg) by the square of their height ( in m):

# BMI = weight(kg) ÷ height²(m²)

# Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

# Example Input
# weight = 80
# height = 1.75

# Example Output
# 80 ÷ (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
# 26

# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# Write your code below this line 👇

bmi = float(weight) / (float(height) ** 2)
# print(height + "÷" + "(" + weight + "x" + weight + ")" + "=" + bmi )
print(int(bmi))

# Teacher's answer
bmi = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2
bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
print(bmi_as_int)


# Solution
# Write your code below this line 👇

weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)

# Using the exponent operator **
bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# or using multiplication and PEMDAS
bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)

print(bmi_as_int)
